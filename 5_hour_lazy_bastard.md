How to launch rocket under 5 hours being lazy bastard (manually craft less than 111 items).
Version: ???


## Blue science
You'd want to plan to have 12 blue science = 1 science bottle per second
Now you'll need:
* 8 Red circuit factories (1/s)
  * 1 Copper cable factory (4/s)
  * 1 Plastic bar factory (2/s)
  * 1 Green circuit factory (2/s)
* 5 Battery plants (1/s)
  * 1(0.4) SulfAcid (2/s)
    * 1 Sulfur (2/s)
* 1(0.5) Filter inserter factory (1/s)
  * 1(0.5) Fast inserter (1/s)
    * 1 Green circuit factory (2/s)
    * 1 (0.5) Inserter factory (1/s)
      * 1 (0.5) Green circuit factory (1/s)
      * 1 (0.5) Iron gear wheel factory (1/s)
  * 2 Green circuit factory (4/s)
* 18(17.5) Steel factories (1/s). Or 9(8.75) Electric furnaces

== Oil refinery ==
(advanced)
| Refinery      | ChPlant (1.25 cs)   | ChPlant (normalized to 1 cs) | ChPlant, per sec         |
| 5s -> 5.5 GAS | -                   | -                            | -                        |
| 5s -> 4.5 LO  | (5s, 3 LO) -> 2 Gas | (5s, 3.75 LO) -> 2.5 Gas     | (1s, 0.75 LO) -> 0.5 Gas |
| 5s -> 1 HO    | (5s, 4 HO) -> 3 LO  | (5s, 5 HO) -> 3.75 LO        | (1s, 1 HO) -> 0.75 LO    |

Note:
* 3.75 = 15/4
Refinery + ChPlant, full gas = 5 refineries, 1 HO, 7 LO
* 5s -> 1 HO -1/5CP-> 0.75 LO
* 5s -> 4.5 LO + 0.75 LO = 5.25 LO (21/4 LO)
* 5s -> 5.25 LO -21/15CP-> 21/15*5/2 Gas = 7/5 CP, 7/2 Gas
* 5s -> 5.5 Gas + 3.5 Gas
